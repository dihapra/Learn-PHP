# Purpose of This Repository

This repository is dedicated to my journey of **relearning** and practicing **PHP programming** through deliberate challenges. It serves as a personal challenge to test my knowledge of PHP and document my progress.

I plan to use this repository as a future reference, whether for:

- Preparing for **job interviews**.
- **Teaching** my students.

It will act as a reminder of the key concepts and techniques in PHP, helping me revisit the language whenever needed.
